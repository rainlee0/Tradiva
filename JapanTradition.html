          <h2>🎎4 Unusual Traditions in Japan:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>•👶Naki Sumo – The Crying Baby Festival</b><br>
        In this 400-year-old tradition, sumo wrestlers hold babies in their arms and try to make them cry. It is believed that a crying baby brings good health and wards off evil spirits. The baby who cries the loudest wins the contest!
        <br><b>💡 Fun Fact:</b><br>
        😭 Some parents even hope their child will cry first, as it is seen as a sign of strength and blessing!
    </li>

    <li><b>•🍆Kanamara Matsuri – The Festival of the Steel Phallus</b><br>
        This unusual fertility festival is held every year in Kawasaki. Large phallic-shaped statues and decorations are displayed to celebrate fertility, marriage, and safe childbirth. Visitors even eat phallus-shaped candies!
        <br><b>💡 Fun Fact:</b><br>
        🛐The festival originally started as a Shinto ritual to protect against STDs (sexually transmitted diseases)!
    </li>

    <li><b>•⚰️Shukatsu – Preparing for Your Own Funeral</b><br>
        In Japan, some elderly people attend workshops where they practice lying in coffins, writing farewell letters, and choosing funeral outfits. This tradition helps them accept death peacefully and avoid burdening their families with last-minute preparations.
        <br><b>💡 Fun Fact:</b><br>
        🪦Some companies offer full "living funerals," where people can attend their own memorial before they pass away!
    </li>

    <li><b>•🏮Hadaka Matsuri – The Naked Festival</b><br>
        During this crazy winter festival, thousands of almost naked men (wearing just a loincloth) gather to compete for a sacred wooden stick thrown by a priest. It is believed that the man who grabs the stick will have a year of good luck.
        <br><b>💡 Fun Fact:</b><br>
        ❄️Despite the freezing weather, participants fight in massive crowds to catch the stick, and some even dive into cold water for purification!
