          <h2>🎎 4 Unusual Traditions in China:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>•🍝 Eating "Longevity Noodles" on Birthdays </b><br>
        In China, eating Longevity Noodles (长寿面 – Chángshòu Miàn) on your birthday is a tradition. The long noodles symbolize a long and prosperous life, and cutting them is believed to bring bad luck.
        <br><b>💡 Fun Fact:</b><br>
        Some Chinese believe that the longer the noodle, the longer your life will be, so they try to eat the longest noodles possible!
    </li>

    <li><b>•⚰️Ghost Marriage – Weddings for the Dead </b><br>
        Ghost marriage (冥婚 – Mínghūn) is a rare but still practiced tradition in some parts of China. If a young unmarried person dies, their family may arrange a marriage between two deceased individuals to bring them peace in the afterlife.
        <br><b>💡 Fun Fact:</b><br>
        Some families "marry" a dead person to a living spouse, believing it will bring good fortune to both the deceased and the living partner.
    </li>

    <li><b>•💦 The Water Splashing Festival – Soaking for Good Luck </b><br>
        Celebrated by the Dai ethnic minority in Yunnan province, the Water Splashing Festival is a fun event where people throw buckets of water at each other. Water is believed to wash away bad luck and bring happiness.
        <br><b>💡 Fun Fact:</b><br>
        The festival lasts for three days, and it’s impossible to stay dry—everyone, including tourists, gets splashed!
    </li>

    <li><b>•🙇 Toe-Touching Greetings – Bowing with Respect </b><br>
        In ancient China, it was customary for younger people to touch the toes of their elders as a sign of deep respect. While this practice is rare today, respectful bowing is still an important part of Chinese etiquette.
        <br><b>💡 Fun Fact:</b><br>
        In modern times, shaking hands has become more common, but in formal settings, a polite nod or slight bow is still preferred.
