            <h2>🎭 4 Unusual Traditions in France</h2>
            
            <h3>• 💋 La Bise – The French Cheek Kiss Greeting</h3>
            <p>In France, it is common to greet people with a kiss on both cheeks. The number of kisses varies by region, from one to four kisses! However, this greeting is usually reserved for friends and family, not strangers.</p>
            <p><b>🔹 Fun Fact:</b> In some areas of southern France, people kiss four times instead of two!</p>

            <h3>• 🐟 April Fish – The French April Fools' Prank</h3>
            <p>Instead of just telling jokes, French people celebrate April Fools’ Day (Poisson d'Avril) by secretly sticking a paper fish on someone's back. If the person doesn’t notice, they become the joke of the day!</p>
            <p><b>🔹 Fun Fact:</b> This tradition dates back to 1564, when France changed its calendar and some people didn’t believe the new year started in January instead of April.</p>

            <h3>• 🍰 The 13 Desserts of Christmas</h3>
            <p>In Provence, it is a tradition to serve 13 different desserts on Christmas Eve, symbolizing Jesus and his 12 apostles. The desserts include dried fruits, nuts, nougat, and traditional French pastries.</p>
            <p><b>🔹 Fun Fact:</b> Each dessert has a symbolic meaning, with nuts representing monks and white nougat symbolizing purity.</p>

            <h3>• 🧀 Presidential Cheese Tasting – A Leader’s Privilege</h3>
            <p>It is a presidential tradition in France for the leader to be served a variety of cheeses after official dinners. France has over 1,600 different types of cheese, and every president is expected to appreciate and promote the country’s cheese culture.</p>
            <p><b>🔹 Fun Fact:</b> Former French President Charles de Gaulle once famously said, "How can you govern a country that has 246 kinds of cheese?"</p>
